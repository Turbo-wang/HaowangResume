- **AI Services**
  - **Background**  
    Built several identity documents OCR HTTP API for Hong Kong Fusion Bank. And built HTTPs APIs that served applications of AI to clients.
  - **OCR Implement**  
    Built a comprehensive OCR pipeline to recognize texts across different document types, which includes training AI models to identify document types, locating text regions, and recognizing words.
  - **AI HTTP Services**  
    Developed HTTP services for a suite of AI models (using Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch) in finance and insurance sectors. Utilized Spring Boot for the development of these HTTP APIs, incorporating advanced frameworks to support data-source integration and persistence, comprehensive logging functionalities, and so on.
- **Fact-Checking Tool**
  - **Background**
    Developed a fact-checking app based on a fast-running checker service to check the factuality of a document.  
  - **Fact-Checking Pipeline**
    Developed the fact-checking pipeline, consisting of document decomposer, decontextualizer, claim-worth checker, evidence retriever, and claim verifier. Enhanced pipeline efficiency through optimization with RabbitMQ and implemented a distributed infrastructure for scalable performance. Utilized vLLM with GPU acceleration for real-time inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving a throughput of 150 queries per second (QPS) for real-time text verification.
- **Pet Community Website**
  - **Background**  
    Designed and implemented the backend system for a pet community website to share and get information about pets. 
  - **Pet Article RESTful API**  
    Developed a RESTful API for user data interaction services and a role-based access control module for article management, both utilizing Spring Boot. Leveraged MySQL for data storage and Redis for key-value database functionalities.
  - **Article Crawl System**  
    Utilized Scrapy to develop a crawling system for aggregating pet-related articles from multiple websites. The system is designed to automatically check and download new articles daily, ensuring up-to-date content collection.
- **Video Labeling System**
  - **Background**  
    Designed and implemented the system of Labeling short videos for Tencent Search and these labels are applied in several results pages.
  - **Extracted labels from title**  
    Trained sequence labeling models based on **Prompt tuning + Bert** to generate videos' labels and achieved a 83.24% AVG-F1 Score. Then deployed it as a HTTP Service. 
  - **Implemented the Program**  
    Built the video data process system in Tencent **spark** data platform and the videos' labels are finally written into the key-value databases for downstream applications. This system processed ten thousand levels of video data every hour. The video labels increased the click rate by 15.3% (from 21.84% to 25.19%) in the video results page. The video labels supported the phrase-filtering and video-collecting functions.
